# Linear equation system solver
## Working
- Solving linear equations with equal amount of variables and equations (or with more equations than variables) using Gauss-Jordan method
## In development:
- Solving linear equations with an infinite amount of solutions (i.e. less equations than variables)
- Checking if the equation has any solutions
- Implementing other solving methods than Gauss-Jordan's
